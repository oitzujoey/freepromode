# Free ProMode

Free ProMode is an OpenArena/Quake III Arena mod that provides CPM physics under a free license. As of right now, the patch only works with OpenArena, but it should be fairly easy to make it work with Ioquake3. The provided pak file is for OpenArena 0.8.8.

Currently supported features:
* Strafe (W + A or D)
* Bunny Hop (A or D)
* CPM W key (I don't know what it is called.)
* Ramp boost

Potential improvements:
* Magic number controlling physics can be modified using Cvars
* Lots and lots of adjustments to make the physics mirror CPM
* Double jump
* Ioquake3 patch
