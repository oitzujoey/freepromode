Free ProMode is an OpenArena mod that provides CPM physics under the GPL v2 license.

## Config

| Type | Cvar | VM | Default | Description |
|-------|-----------------------|--------|:-------:|------------------------------------------------|
| float | g_doublejump | Server | 0 | Give a boost if a jump is done within 400 ms of the last one. |
| float | g_aircontrol | Server | 0 | CPM air control. 0.02 is a good number. |
| float | g_strafeaccelerate | Server | 1 | Air acceleration that is only applied when strafing in a CPM-like mode (g_cpmkbd || g_orikbd) |
| float | g_wishspeed | Server | 30 | The thing that makes you go slow in Q1 |
| bool | g_rampboost | Server | 0 | Give a boost when jumping up ramps. |
| float | g_acclerate | Server | 10 | pm_accelerate: Ground acceleration |
| float | g_airacclerate | Server | 1 | pm_airaccelerate: Air acceleration |
| float | g_friction | Server | 6 | pm_friction: Ground friction |
| bool | g_promode | Server | 0 | Turn CPM movement on or off. |

## Notes
I know that CPM is incorrect. If you have improvements, please tell me. I admit that I used some [code](https://web.archive.org/web/20070214143052/http://games.linuxdude.com/tamaps/archive/cpm1_dev_docs.zip) (It's a zip) that fell under the old Q3A mod license, but I have tried to purge it. This has resulted in a less accurate imitation of CPM physics. At least you have access to the source code as a result.  
Source code is available under GPL v2 at <https://github.com/oitzujoey/origami_mod>. If it is gone, then try looking at <http://www.origamiparade.com>. If that's gone, try <https://www.archive.org>. If that's gone, well... you're probably out of luck, but I'd be amused to know that my mod survived the downfall of civilization.
